Song of the Sea Documentation


Description:

Song of the Sea is a chill 2D fishing game with a rhythmic twist. In this game, each fish has a song unique to them that the player must play in order to catch them. This portion of gameplay is inspired by games such as Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Players can sell the fish they catch for in game currency as well as fill out the fishing compendium to track their progress and see which species they have caught. Players can also buy cosmetics in the shop to alter their gameplay experience and provide a sense of progression.
